Wine is the most commonly used beverage globally, and its values are considered important in society. Wine is an alcoholic drink that is made up of fermented grapes. Quality of wine is important for its consumers, mainly for producers in the present competitive market to raise the revenue.  Wine quality refers to the factors that go into producing a wine, as well as the indicators or characteristics that tell you if the wine is of high quality. Historically, wine quality used to be determined by testing at the end of the production. 


If you have come across wine then you will notice that wine has also their type, they are red and white wine. According to experts, wine is differentiated according to its smell, flavour, and colour, but we are not wine experts to say that wine is good or bad. Every person has their own opinion about the tastes, so identifying a quality based on a personâ€™s taste is challenging. Judging the quality of wine manually is a really tough task, even the professional wine tasters have the accuracy of 71%.


In this project, we present a wine quality prediction technique that utilizes historical data to train simple machine learning models which are more accurate and can help us know the quality of wine. The models can be run on much less resource intensive environments. From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration and IBM deployment.
